Explain how to enter a move and see that a legal movement that stays within the hallway updates the player's location
* The tiles within the Board are JButtons and the player can only move towards tiles that are around him/her and are horizontal or vertical to the player on the board.  If you click on the tiles that are not doors into or out a room, the player will not go through the walls or make any other invalid movements such as moving diagonally or outside of the board.

Explain how to enter a move and see that a legal movement that goes through a doorway and ends in a room updates the player's location
* Click around the Colored Tile that represents the player until you reach a gray tile that represents a doorway and stand on it. It will launch a prompt to make a suggestion and after that is made then your turn will end. No other player will be able to move through a player because it is impossible.



Explain how to enter a move which uses a secret passageway updates the player's location
* Traverse through the board and click your way to the corner rooms of the board. Here you will find an orange tile that will represent the secret passageway that a player can take. Moving to the orange tile will move the player to a different corner room.  The player’s colored tile move diagonally to the other side of the board.

Explain how illegal moves are prevented (including showing an error message if your program allows a user to try this).
* Illegal moves are prevented by checking if the current player’s tile does not represent an invalid movement. For example, a player cannot walk through walls because the tiles are different and will not allow the movement to execute.  Only doorways allow access to rooms and if you try to make a move diagonally the UI will not allow the player to move.
