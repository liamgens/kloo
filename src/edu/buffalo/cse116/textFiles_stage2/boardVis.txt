Explain how to see the program board in your GUI:
* After a number is entered into the Command Prompt (let’s say 6), the board GUI will be generated. On the board, you will see a colorful grid of tiles (25X25). The turquoise tiles represent the Hallways, the dark blue tiles represent the Rooms, the light gray tiles represent the Doors, the orange tiles at the corner of the board that represent the Secret Passage, the dark gray tiles which represent the center of the board and the Red, Pink, White, Green, Cyan, and Yellow Tiles which represent the 6 Players in the game. To the right of the board grid is a panel that shows the current player, current roll (how many moves are left in turn), a button labeled accusation that will prompt a user to make an accusation, and below the board there is the text that displays the card values in the current player's’ hand. The title is “Kloo” and you can minimize, maximize and exit the Gui with the default controls on the top of the Gui.

Explain how to see that the 6 players are shown at their starting location when the game begins:
   * The Starting locations are located on several points on the map.  Each player starts in a hallway (turquoise tile) near the edge of the board.  The six players are represented by their respective colors on the board.  These initial positions of these colored tiles are their starting locations.

Explain how to see the program can display updated player locations when their location changes:
   * If you click around the Current Player’s Tile at a distance of 1, the player will move to that location until the Current Roll is exhausted and the user can no longer move. The player will only be allowed to move to a valid location and players can only  enter a room through a door (gray tile) or secret passage (orange tile).  When a player moves, their colored tile is moved to their new position and their previous position’s tile color is changed to turquoise or whatever color the tile would be without a character occupying it.
